    <h2><font color=green">Yashoda</font></h2>
    <p>Yashoda  is the foster-mother of Krishna and the wife of Nanda. She is described in the Puranic texts of Hinduism as the wife
     of Nanda, the chieftain of Gokulam, and the sister of Rohini.Some people say that Mother Yashoda was previously Dhara, who sought 
     a boon from Brahma to be born as the mother of Krishna. While this is mentioned in Srimad Bhagavatam and other scriptures, it 
     is important to get the correct understanding of such verses.Drona is said to be born in Vraja as Nanda and Dharā as Yasoda. 
     Actually, however, it should be understood that Drona and Dhara were sadhana-siddhas (those who perfected their Bhakti by sadhana), who 
     later entered into the bodies of Nitya-Siddha forms of Nanda and Yasoda.Dhara, who is the wife of the best of the Vasus named Drona, was
      born on the planet of devatas. In the heavenly planets, by hearing about Krishna's pastimes from Narada and others, Drona and Dhara 
      developed the desire to become the parents of Lord Krishna. Thus, they rendered loving devotional service unto Krishna. One should 
      understand that Drona and Dhara performed Shuddha Bhakti (unadulterated by austerity and yoga). They only prayed for Prema Bhakti.
       Thus, they were able to receive the mercy of the Nitya Siddha associates- Mother Yashoda and Nanda Maharaja.Since Drona and Dhara
        became infused with the mercy (krpa shakti) of the Nitya siddha associates, they are also considered the partial expansions of
         Nanda Maharaja and Mother Yashoda respectively.Finally, when Lord Krishna manifested His eternal pastimes of Goloka in Gokula 
         Dhama, Dhara and Drona merged their respective forms into the forms of Mother Yashoda and Nanda Maharaja and thus were able
          to taste the Vatsalya Prema of being the parents of Lord Krishna. This is the confidential understanding given by our
           acharyas.</p>
    <h2><font color="indigo">why was Yashoda chosen to be Sri Krishna's foster mother?</font></h2>
    <center><img src="./yashoda.jpg"height="300px"width="300px"></center>
    <p>According to the Bhagavata Purana, Krishna was born to Devaki, but Krishna's father, Vasudeva, brought the newborn Krishna to 
    his cousin Nanda, and his wife, Yashoda, in Gokulam. This was for his upbringing, as well as to protect Krishna from Devaki's
     brother, Kamsa, the tyrannical king of Mathura.The name Yashoda means one who is giver of fame or glory.The relationship between 
     Yashoda and Sri Krishna is one of the most celebrated mother-son relationships of all time. Yashoda's unfathomable love for Krishna
      has inspired many works of art. She is an integral part of Krishna's childhood lilas. Once, when sage Narada visited Nanda's 
      house, he was greeted with one of the most divine sights. Narada watched on as Mother Yashoda punished her mischievous little 
      boy Krishna by tying him with a grinding stone. Seeing this, Narada said, “Enna Thavam Saidhanai, Yashoda” which translates 
      as “What penance have You (Mother Yashoda) undertaken to be bestowed with the powers to punish the supreme (Narayana)”.
       Because here was the Supreme Godhead— “the beginning and the end and also the middle” who let Himself being chastised by 
       a mere mortal!

       Sri Krishna was born to Devaki and Vasudeva. But as fate would have it, it was Yashoda and Nanda who brought Him up. So, it
        was not Devaki but Yashoda who could witness all the beautiful lilas of Sri Krishna as He turned into a magnificent youth
         who mesmerised everyone who came in contact with Him.Legend has it that one day little Krishna was playing in the sand and 
         put it into His mouth. Mother Yashoda was concerned and asked her son to open His mouth. However, she was not ready for what 
         happened next. She saw the entire universe inside that little mouth. There were the seven oceans and also Narayana resting 
         on Adishesha (the Divine Snake) with his consort Mahalakshmi.It is believed that Yashoda and Nanda performed great penance 
         in their previous birth. Lord Vishnu was happy with their prayers and appeared in front of them. He asked the couple what 
         they wanted and the couple said that they wanted to treat Lord Vishnu as their son. Lord Vishnu was amused because He is 
         the Creator of the whole universe. However, He never knew what a mother's love is and that is why conceded to the request
          and granted them this boon. Hence when Lord Vishnu appeared on the earth in His Krishna avatar, it was Yashoda who brought
           him up despite not being the biological mother of Sri Krishna.
    </p>
    <h2><font color="mediumvioletred">How did Yashoda become Sri Krishna's mother for the second time?</font></h2>
    Yashoda did not meet Krishna ever since He left Mathura. However, when on her deathbed, Krishna came to meet His mother. 
    She was happy but her only regret was that she could never see any of Krishna's marriages. Sri Krishna understood His 
    mother's pain and said that her wish would be fulfilled in her next birth when He would be born as Venkateshwara and Mother
     Yashoda as Vakula Devi.

     <h2><font color="lightseagreen">Mother Yashoda as Vakula Devi</font></h2>
     <p>In the Kali Yuga, Lord Vishnu appeared as Lord Venkateswara. This time too, Yashoda was His foster mother. Her name was
         Vakula Devi. She played a crucial role in arranging His wedding with King Akasa Raja's daughter Padmavati. And this 
         time, Mother Yashoda as Vakula Devi, fulfilled her wishes to see her son's marriage.Roughly 300 years back, a temple
          dedicated to Vakula Devi was constructed on Perurubanda hillock surrounding the picturesque Perur village.The idol of
           Vakula Devi looks towards the Seven Hills, the abode of her son Lord Venkateswara.The relationship between Yashoda and
            Sri Krishna is not just a bond between a mother and her son. In a way, Mother Yashoda is also one of the most ardent 
            devotees of Sri Krishna. What begins as 'Vatsalya Prem' (love for her son) evolves into 'Vatsalya Bhakti' (devotion of a mother).</p>
