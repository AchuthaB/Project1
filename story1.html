        <p>The Ramayana is an ancient Indian epic, composed some time in the 5th century BCE, about the exile and then return of Rama,prince
             of Ayodhya. It was composed in Sanskrit by the sage Valmiki, who taught it to Rama's sons, the twins Lava and Kush.
             The name Ramayaṇa is composed of two words, Rama and ayaṇa. Rama, the name of the main character of the epic, 
             has two contextual meanings. In the Atharvaveda, it means 'dark, dark-coloured, black' and is related to the word ratri which means
            'darkness or stillness of night'. The other meaning, which can be found in the Mahabharata, is 'pleasing, pleasant, charming, lovely, beautiful'.
            The word ayana means travel or journey. Thus, Rāmāyaṇa means "Rama's journey",with ayana altered to ayaṇa due to the Sanskrit grammar rule of internal sandhi.
            The Ramayana was an important influence on later Sanskrit poetry and the Hindu life and culture, and its main characters were fundamental to the cultural consciousness 
            of a number of nations, both Hindu and Buddhist.Its most important moral influence was the importance of virtue, in the life of a citizen and in the ideals
             of the formation of a state.The Ramayana belongs to the genre of Itihasa, narratives of past events (purāvṛtta), which includes the Mahabharata, the Puranas, and the Ramayana.
              The genre also includes teachings on the goals of human life. It depicts the duties of relationships, portraying ideal characters like the ideal father, the ideal servant, the 
              ideal brother, the ideal husband, and the ideal king.Like the Mahabharata, Ramayana presents the teachings of ancient Hindu sages in the narrative allegory, interspersing 
              philosophical and ethical elements.In its extant form, Valmiki's Ramayana is an epic poem of some 24,000 verses, divided into seven kāṇḍas (Balakanda, Ayodhyakanda, Aranyakanda,
               Kiskindakanda, Sundarakanda, Yuddhakanda, Uttarakanda), and about 500 sargas (chapters)

    <p>Dasharath, king of Ayodhya, had no children. So he arranged a Putra-kameshti sacrifice (putra = son, kameshti = that which is desired). 
    At the sacrifice, Agni (god of fire) arose from the flames and handed the king a golden vase brimming with nectar. "Give this to your queens", 
    said the god and disappeared. The king had three wives. To the eldest, the king gave half of the nectar; the second queen got a portion that 
    remained when the queen had drunk her half. To the youngest queen, the king gave the remaining half of the nectar and again, the second queen got
     the portion that remained. In time, the queens gave birth to sons: to the eldest was born Rama,to the youngest was born Bharat, 
     and to the second queen were born the twins Lakshman and Shatrughna.Rama (or Ramacandra) is the seventh avatar of the Hindu god Vishnu.
      His adventures include the slaying of the demon king Ravana which is recounted in the Vana Parva of the Mahabharata and in the Ramayana, the
       oldest Sanskrit epic, written sometime in the 5th century BCE but with some later additions. Lord Rama, considered by many Hindus to be based 
       on an historical figure, is perhaps the most virtuous hero from Hindu mythology and he, along with his wife Sita, are a picture of purity and
        marital devotion. Further, the adventures of Rama illustrate above all the importance and rewards of fulfilling one's pious duty or dharma.Rama 
        is the hero of the Ramayana epic, an incarnation of the God Vishnu. The eldest and favourite son of Dasaratha, King of Ayodhya, he is a virtuous
         prince and is much loved by the people. He is exiled from Ayodhya due to the plotting of his stepmother, Kaikeyi.Rama is a sat purushah — a person
          with innate goodness. He is satyadharmaparaayanah — always an adherent of truth and dharma. He is like the moon in His pleasing quality. He has the 
          quality of kshama — a forgiving nature, like the Earth which bears so many burdens.Lord Rama is beloved, respected, and adored for the virtues he 
          embodied: dharma, valor, chivalry, loyalty, compassion, love, obedience, courage, and equipoise. For many in India, Lord Rama personifies the 
          characteristics of the ideal human being.</p>
      <h2><font color="olivedrab">Rama marries Sita</font></h2>
         <p>When the princes had grown up some, the sage Vishwamitra arrived at Dasharath's court and asked that Rama and Lakshman be "lent" to him to help 
        him rid his hermitage of the demons that were plaguing the ashram dwellers by defiling their sacrifices with blood and bones, and by killing them off. 
        After the two princes successfully rid the ashram of the demons, the sage took them to the neighbouring kingdom of Mithila to show them the swayamvar 
        festivities of the Mithila princess, Sita, born of the earth. The king of that country had adopted Sita as his daughter and, after Sita had grown up,
         had declared that he would give her in marriage to anyone who could string the Great Bow of Shiva. 
        No one could. Several kings, princes, and commoners had tried and failed.The swayamvar had been in progress for several months now and the bow still remained unstrung. 
        It was to this place that the sage Vishwamitra brought the two princes of Ayodhya. Rama and Lakshamn entered the assembly hall where the bow was displayed in all its glory. 
        Rama walked over, picked up the bow, strung it, and plucked the bowstring with such a twang that two things happened simultaneously: the twang was heard for miles around, 
        and the force of it broke the bow into two with so great a sound that the king and his courtiers came running from their chambers to see what the commotion was about. 
        When the confusion had settled, Rama was married to Sita. His three brothers were married to a sister and cousins of Sita, and there were many festivities and much 
        rejoicing in the two kingdoms.

        <h2><font color="medium purple">Rama is exiled</font></h2>
        <p>Some time later, Dasharath decided he had grown too old to rule and declared he would abdicate in favour of Rama, the eldest born and the crown prince. 
            This is when his youngest queen invoked an old promise that Dasharath had made to her: she demanded that Rama be exiled for 14 years and that her own son, Bharat, be crowned king. 
            Dasharath refused but Rama decided to honour his father's old promise and left for the forests. He was accompanied by Sita and by Lakshman, both of whom could not be dissuaded from following him. 
            In grief at the injustice of it all and at Rama's departure, Dasharath died within two days.

            Bharat was not in Ayodhya when these events happened. he, and the fourth prince Shatrughna, were away holidaying at Bharat's maternal grandfather's country. 
            They were summoned to Ayodhya in haste and, when Bharat learnt what had happened, he was furious. He shouted at his mother, refused to ascend the throne, and 
            gathered the townsfolk around him to proceed to the forest and bring Rama back.Rama refused to return, stating his intention to serve his father's last wish 
            by being an exile for the full 14 years. Bharat returned with Rama's sandals, placed them on the throne, and proceeded to rulethe country in Rama's name. 
            Meanwhile, Rama moved further south even deeper into the forests so that the people of Ayodhya would not find it easy to keep coming to his hut and begging him to return.

        <p>One day, a demoness named Surpanakha saw Rama and, being charmed out of her wits by his beauty, walked up to him and begged him to marry her. "I already have a wife", said
            Rama and pointed to Sita. "Why don't you marry my brother Lakshman instead?" When Surpanakha turned towards Lakshman, he declared he'd taken a temporary vow of celibacy 
            and sent her back to Rama. What followed was that the brothers took turns to thus play ping-pong with her and when Surpanakha, by now angry beyond measure, rushed
            towards Sita to kill her, Lakshmana cut off Surpanakha's nose and ears.One day, a demoness named Surpanakha saw Rama and, being charmed out of her wits by his

            Surpanakha flew towards Lanka (modern Sri Lanka), ruled by her brother Ravana, and complained. Enraged, Ravana vowed vengeance. He persuaded the demon Marich to disguise
            himself as a golden deer and wander near Rama's hut. When Sita saw the golden deer, she begged Rama to get it for her. When the brothers were out pursuing the deer, Ravana 
            arrived, abducted Sita, placed her in his flying chariot, and flew through the skies to Lanka. When the princes, after having killed the golden deer and discovered it was a
            demon in disguise, returned to their hut, they found it empty and started to look for Sita.</p>
            <h2>Rama meets Hanuman</h2>
            <img align="left"src="./hanuma.webp"height="220px"width="220px">
            <p>Sri Rama and His brother Lakshmana were walking in the forests of Rushyamukha Parvata near river Pampa. Sugriva saw two youngsters armed with bows and arrows, and he was
                 terrified because he thought his brother Vali had sent them to kill him. Sugriva ran away from there to see his Ministers, one of them was Hanuman. Hanuman stopped the
                  Vanara King, Sugriva, from running and asked him.Then Hanuman disguised as a sanyasi and approached those two heroes, Rama and Lakshman. He spoke graciously,” You look 
                  like Rajarshis and Taapasis but are armed with swords, bows, and arrows. Animals in this jungle are frightened in your presence. Your eyes look like lotus petals, and 
                  you have a broad chest. You seem unbeatable in a fight and look like the savior of the lives of many. But you seem to be gods disguised as humans. These contradictory 
                  observations wonder me a lot.”After listening to Hanuman, Rama said to Lakshmana, “Lakshmana, Did you observe how articulate Hanuman spoke! There is nothing impossible
                   to a king who has a minister like him. Even a foe who came to kill the cannot act after listening to Hanuman. A king is so lucky to have a minister like him. By analyzing
                    his words, he seems to be well acknowledged with Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda, Vyakaran (Grammar), and the essence of Upanishads. One can never talk like this without that 
                    knowledge. His eyebrows and forehead didn't move unnecessarily. His voice was neither too loud nor like a mutter or whisper. He started, continued, and completed his words
                     in a single tone. He particularly knows how to spell every syllable. Sugriva is very lucky to have Hanuma as his minister. Convey him our purpose of presence in this forest."
                     During their wanderings, the princes came upon a group of monkeys who showed them some ornaments of Sita's: the monkeys 
                  had seen a beautiful lady crying and dropping her ornaments from a chariot in the sky that was being driven southwards by a demon.Among the monkeys was Hanuman, who
                   ultimately located Sita's whereabouts to be in Ravana's kingdom in Lanka. Rama gained the help of the monkey chief Sugreeva, gathered a monkey army, marched southwards, built
                    a bridge across the ocean and crossed over to Lanka. Rama, after an epic battle, was then able to kill Ravana and finally free Sita.

            <p>When Sita walked up to Rama, however, he refused to accept her since she had been a living in a demon's palace all this while. Hurt, Sita entered into a burning pyre intending
                 to give up her life. However, Agni rose from the flames, carrying an unhurt Sita in his arms and said:This event came to be known as the Agni Pareeksha (agni = fire, pareeksha = test).</p>
