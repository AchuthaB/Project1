    <p>The Bhagavad Gita (“Song of God” or “Song of the Lord”) is among the most important religious texts of Hinduism and easily the
         best known. It has been quoted by writers, poets, scientists, theologians, and philosophers  among others  for centuries and
        is often the introductory text to Hinduism for a Western audience.It is commonly referred to as the Gita and was originally
        part of the great Indian epic Mahabharata. Its date of composition, therefore, is closely associated with that of the epic 
         5th-3rd century BCE  but not all scholars agree that the work was originally included in the Mahabharata text and so
        date it later to c. 2nd century BCE.The Gita is a dialogue between the warrior-prince Arjuna and the god Krishna who
         is serving as his charioteer at the Battle of Kurukshetra fought between Arjuna's family and allies (the Pandavas) and
          those of the prince Duryodhana and his family (the Kauravas) and their allies. This dialogue is recited by the Kauravan 
          counselor Sanjaya to his blind king Dhritarashtra (both far from the battleground) as Krishna has given Sanjaya mystical
           sight so he will be able to see and report the battle to the king.The Kauravas and Pandavas are related and there are
            mutual friends and family members fighting on both sides for supremacy of rule. Accordingly, when Arjuna sees all his
             former friends and comrades on the opposing side, he loses heart and refuses to take part in a battle which will result
              in their deaths as well as many others. The rest of the text is the dialogue between the prince and the god on what
               constitutes right action, proper understanding and, ultimately, the meaning of life and nature of the Divine.The Gita
                combines the concepts expressed in the central texts of Hinduism -the Vedas and Upanishads -which are here synthesized
                 into a single, coherent vision of belief in one God and the underlying unity of all existence. The text instructs on
                  how one must elevate the mind and soul to look beyond appearances -which fool one into believing in duality
                   and multiplicity - and recognize these are illusions; all humans and aspects of existence are a unified extension 
                   of the Divine which one will recognize once the trappings of illusion have been discarded.The Gita inspired the 
                   Bhakti (“devotion”) Movement which then influenced the development of Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism. Krishna 
                   explains the path of selfless devotion as one of the paths toward self-actualization, recognition of the truth
                    of existence, and liberation from the cycle of rebirth and death; the other two being jnana (“knowledge”) and 
                    karma (“action”). The Hare Krishna Movement of the present day is an expression of Bhakti, and the Gita remains
                     their principal text.</p>
                     <h2><font color="darkorange">Vedas, Upanishads, & the Three Gunas</font></h2>
                     <p>Hinduism is known to adherents as Sanatan Dharma (“Eternal Order” or “Eternal Path”) and is informed at its fundamental
                         level by the texts known as the Vedas which also include subtexts known as the Upanishads. The word Veda means “knowledge”, and
                          Upanishad is interpreted to mean to “sit down closely” as though drawing near for instruction from a master. The Vedas convey
                           the essential knowledge of the universe; the Upanishads instruct one on how to use that knowledge.The vision of the Vedas and
                            Upanishads, in its simplest and most concise form, is that there is a single entity -Brahman who is the creator of existence 
                            and existence itself. Human beings carry a spark of this great Divinity within themselves known as the Atman. The purpose of
                             life is to reach the self-actualization of the Atman which will then bring one into union with Brahman in life after one
                              experiences physical death. One achieves this self-actualization through the performance of one's dharma (duty) in 
                              accordance with one's karma (right action) to eventually attain moksha (liberation) and the recognition of Final Truth. 
                              If one does not attain self-actualization in a given lifetime, one is reincarnated and must try again.
                              <center><img src="./krishna.webp"height="300px"width="300px"></center>
                              Standing in the way of one's self-actualization are worldly distractions in the form of the three gunas - qualities, 
                              characteristics, states of mind - inherent in each individual. The gunas are:
                              Sattva - wisdom, goodness, enlightenment
                              Rajas - passion, activity, aggression
                              Tamas - darkness, confusion, helplessness
                              The gunas are not a hierarchy one needs to work through from bottom to top but all three exist, to greater or lesser 
                              degrees, in every individual. The confusion of Tamas can be caused by the passion of Rajas and the urge toward goodness 
                              or wisdom of Sattva. The gunas help to enslave the mind by interpreting the world one sees as the truth  as the way life
                               and the universe truly are - and so trap one in the cycle of rebirth and death (samsara), keeping one from self-actualization
                                by diverting attention from the truth of reality to what one has been taught to accept as reality.The best illustration of 
                                this is the interpretation of death as a tragic loss both for the deceased and for the survivors. One's natural response to 
                                death is sorrow and anger at the loss or, for those experiencing the decline in health of a terminal disease, fear of the 
                                unknown and rage at being forced to leave all one knows behind. The sages of the Upanishads and the figure of Krishna in
                                 the Gita would say these responses are simply the gunas at work. One is conditioned to respond emotionally to loss 
                                 but, depending on which of the three gunas is most dominant in an individual, one will express that emotion in different ways. 
                                 The soul possessing more of Sattva will be inclined to be philosophical and optimistic; of Rajas, angry and aggressive; of 
                                 Tamas, inconsolable and despairing.None of these responses, Krishna would say, are appropriate because the person who has died
                                  has not ceased to exist and one commits a serious spiritual error in responding as though they have. Even the response of Sattva
                                   is not wholly appropriate because it supposes an end to life, a discontinuity, when there is none. The soul is immortal, existed
                                    before birth, and exists after death. This understanding is emphasized in the Upanishads and illustrated dramatically throughout
                                     the Gita which stresses the importance of moving beyond what seems to be true toward actual Truth.

                        <h2><font color="darkcyan">Gita</font></h2>
                        <p>While Pandu and his wives were gone, Dhritarashtra and Gandhari had produced 100 children, the oldest of whom was Duryodhana, known
                             as the Kauravas. Rivalry between Duryodhana's side of the family and the five sons of Kunti informs the rest of the story which
                              finally results in the armies of the two branches of the family facing each other at the Battle of Kurukshetra.This is where
                               the action of the Gita takes place, just before the battle is about to begin. Krishna, in his present incarnation, is related 
                               to both sides and declares he will fight for neither but assist both. He serves as Arjuna's charioteer and, as both armies move
                                into position for battle, Arjuna asks Krishna to drive him to the center of the field so he can look upon all of those who are 
                                so eager for war. When Krishna obliges, Arjuna sees his friends, relatives, old teachers, counselors, all of the people who 
                                played a part in his life and made him who he is. He tells Krishna that he cannot be a part of any action that will result in
                                 so much death and misery. He throws down his great bow and declares he will not fight.
                                 Prior to the battle, Krishna endowed the counselor Sanjaya with a kind of second sight so that, even miles away, he could see
                                  everything taking place on the battlefield and report it precisely to Dhritarashtra. The Gita begins with Dhritarashtra asking
                                   Sanjaya what is happening at Kurukshetra; Sanjaya then narrates Arjuna's despair, Krishna's response, and the whole of their 
                                   dialogue which finally culminates in Arjuna's understanding of the nature of existence, his place in the cosmic order, and 
                                   why he has to take part in the coming battle.The Mahabharata then continues as Arjuna picks up his bow to fight. The Pandavas 
                                   win but at the cost of almost their entire army. Duryodhana and the Kauravas are all killed. Yudhishthira and his brothers then 
                                   rule the land for 36 years before abdicating in order to pursue peace in their final days in the Himalayas where they die and
                                    are brought to paradise.

                                    <p>The action of the Gita, Arjuna's despair, and final realization of Truth touches on many different aspects of Hindu belief 
                                        but central is the concept of dharma and an ordered universe where each person has a responsibility to do what they have 
                                        been placed on earth to do and which no one else can accomplish. Krishna impresses on Arjuna how he is a warrior, and it
                                         is a warrior's duty to take up arms and engage in battle, but this argument fails to convince Arjuna because all he sees 
                                         are his friends and relatives who will soon be killed.Krishna then has to go beyond the conventional argument of dharma to
                                          explain its underlying form, importance, and how one is only distracted from it by the gunas which contribute to false
                                           understanding and the acceptance of illusion. In one of the most famous passages of the Gita, Krishna tells Arjuna:The
                                            soul is immortal, Krishna is saying, and so death is only an illusion. Death is discarding a body that no longer
                                             functions but it has nothing to do with the Higher Self of an individual, the Atman, which is immortal and, once 
                                             it has shed the body, will return to its eternal home through union with Brahman. One must break free of illusion
                                              to recognize the truth that all things observable and unobservable are actually Brahman all of the people in the
                                            armies facing each other on the battlefield are Brahman  all of the people of the country  everyone, everywhere 
                                            is Brahman. One is free to pursue right action in life once one understands the essential unity of all things.This 
                                            recognition encourages detachment from the seeming consequences of one's actions. One must realize, Krishna is
                                             saying, that engaging or refusing to engage in a certain course because one is focused on the probable outcome 
                                             is to be blinded by illusion which will cause one to fail in performing their essential duty in life. One must
                                              detach one's self from the consequences of one's action and focus on what must be done, no matter how seemingly 
                                              painful, in order to play the part one has been given in the Eternal Order of the universe.In Arjuna's case, refusing 
                                              to fight is refusing to do his dharma which means not only evading his responsibilities but denying the truth of the 
                                              nature of existence. The battle must be fought because all the overtures and attempts to resolve the conflict peacefully 
                                              have failed. Those involved have all made choices which have brought them to Kurukshetra and battle; there is no way, at
                                               this point, that Arjuna can do anything other than fight, even if he does not wish to. Once Arjuna realizes this, he is
                                                at peace with what he must do, and the battle commences.This dramatic situation, of course, applies to anyone in the same
                                                 situation facing some difficulty they would prefer to avoid. An audience is comforted by the Gita in that if Arjuna could
                                                  recognize his dharma and kill his friends, relatives, and former teachers, then whatever one may be facing in one's own life 
                                                  should be much easier to bear.</p>
                                            <h2><font color="maroon">Conclusion</font></h2>
                                            <p>There are many other aspects to the Gita than just the importance of dharma. Krishna's speeches throughout 18 chapters
                                                 illustrate the nature of the Divine, Divine Love, how an individual should respond, and how the universe is ordered. 
                                                 At one point, Krishna  who is an avatar of the god Vishnu - reveals himself as Brahman itself thereby showing how
                                                  all the many gods of Hinduism are also Brahman in varied forms. Krishna also discusses the so-called Caste 
                                                  System (the varnas) which allows each individual to perform his dharma without distraction. The four varnas are:

                                                Brahmana varna - highest caste, teachers, priests, intellectuals
                                                Kshatriya varna - warriors, police, protectors, guardians
                                                Vaishya varna - merchants, farmers, bankers, clerks
                                                Shudra varna - lowest caste, servants, laborers, unskilled workers
                                                The emphasis of the Gita on devotion, knowledge, and right action in understanding and drawing near to God would seem to
                                                 preclude a legal caste system which confines one to the social class of his or her birth. The Laws of Manu, however, sidestep
                                                  this criticism by claiming that the caste system is divinely ordained and part of Universal Order. One has been born to 
                                                  a certain caste because of the karma of a past life which must be dealt with in this life because it was neglected before.As
                                                   noted, the Gita would inspire the religious movements which would come to be known as Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism, all
                                                    of which to greater or lesser degrees emphasize the importance of devotion to a personal God, Higher Power, or
                                                     Greater Good as central to their vision. The Gita has since inspired many others besides the famous Hare Krishna 
                                                     movement of the present day through the compassion of its message of Universal Love, emphasis on personal responsibility 
                                                     to one's self and others, and the underlying unity of all living things.</p>
